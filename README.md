# React Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to React coding challenges from HackerRank.  
Each challenge is in its own folder as a small runnable project.



## Running a Challenge

Example installation:

```bash
cd CryptoExchange
npm install
npm run dev
```

## HackerRank Constraints
- Test cases forced certain approaches, even if not ideal. E.g using `type="number"` for monetary inputs.

## What I Would Do Differently
- Use `type="text"` and validate input manually.
- Add accessibility enhancements.
- Include more robust error handling for edge cases.
