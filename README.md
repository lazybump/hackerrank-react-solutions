# React Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to React coding challenges from HackerRank.  
Each challenge is in its own folder as a small runnable project.



## Running a Challenge

Example installation:

```bash
cd CryptoExchange
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Constraints

The HackerRank environment constrains developers to certain solutions due to the pre-written and read-only test suites. For instance, I was forced to use an input element of type="number" in the CryptoExchange challenge, despite it not being ideal. I tried to use the recommended type="text" but it made it impossible to pass the tests, so I had to work around this to ensure the tests passed but it means some edge cases aren't adequately handled.
