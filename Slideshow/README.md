# Slideshow

## Requirements

2. When the application loads, the first slide must be rendered.
3. Clicking on the "Next" button shows the next slide. This button should be disabled when the current slide is the last one.
4. Clicking on the "Prev" button shows the previous slide. This button should be disabled when the current slide is the first one.
5. Clicking on the "Restart" button returns to the first slide. This button should be disabled when the current slide is the first one.
