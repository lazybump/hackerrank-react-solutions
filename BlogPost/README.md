# Blog Posts

This task was to build functionality for a blog that allows users to create, display, and delete posts.

## User Requirements

1. There should be two user input fields: one for the post tiel and another for the post description (textarea).
2. The application should display a "Create" button that, when clicked, adds a new blog post to the list of existing posts.
3. The "Create" button should only add a post if both the title and description fields have values. If either field is empty, the button should not create a post.
4. Once a post is successfully created, both the title and description fields should be cleared.
5. The list of created blog posts should be displayed in a grid layout, with each post appearing inside a box.
6. Each box should include:
   - The post's title
   - The post's description
   - A "Delete" button remove the specific post from the list.
